# Gan-Studio
Here are the steps to run my bakery website :
1.	The application has been uploaded to my GitHub repository: https://github.com/Hari555Y/Gan-Studio.
2.	In case to deploy the website, we can directly copy and paste the link given below in our browser:
http://Hari555Y.github.io/Gan-Studio.
3.	Functionalities added: 
a.	I have added four products with their name, prices, add to cart, and delete to cart functionalities. 
b.	On clicking add button, we can see in the console that the item has been added to the cart.
c.	Every time we add it, its quantity will be increased by one
d.	And it will be decreased by one in case of pressing the delete button
e.	Each action can be seen after pressing the button in the console.
4.	In case of pressing the checkout button, all the payloads we have added to the cart will be shown in the console.
5.	Three properties of every item added will be “ID,” “name,” and “quantity.”
6.	I have added the Show me cart link to add some basic routing, and on clicking it, we will see our cart and the items present in it.
7.	We will return to our home page by pressing the back button on the browser.
